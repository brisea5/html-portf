<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi I'm Bri, on TikTok my username is brisea5. I have about 16k followers. 
  I love Tiktok because it fills my day with light and joy. Everyone feels like family and
  I feel welcomed. It is never a boring place on Tiktok. </p>
<p>I started posting random everyday events on Tiktok. Mostly about unfair and sad things. Like my car getting vandalized and things happening around me. 
  Basically news and things i would witness as well. I also posted my dog and money making ideas. 
</p>

<p> Moreover Tiktok is set to be banned in 3 days. It has been rumored to be banned since 2021 but this time it is known that it will be happening. It was only extended until January 19 2025. For now 
  everyone has been migrating to rednote. Rednote is a Chinease ranned company used mostly by China. As americans we are known as 
  Tiktok refugees on the app becuase we no longer are able to use tiktok. We are starting to learn chinease and have had enough with Tiktok. Tiktok was owned by China as well unitl it was forcforlly sold to the USA. Now that the 
  US owns Tiktok they decided it wasnt enough and still want to ban it. So as I am writing this it is Jan 16 2025.
